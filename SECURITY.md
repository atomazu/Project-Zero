## Security Policy

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is not currently a top priority for me since this is a small personal project. However, if you discover a security vulnerability that you believe to be serious, please let me know by contacting me through email or GitHub issues.

Please note that until the game is released, I cannot guarantee full security measures. Once the game is released, I will take reasonable measures to ensure the security of user data and the game itself. However, please keep in mind that as a small developer, I may not have the resources to fully mitigate all security risks and issues. 

Thank you for your understanding.
