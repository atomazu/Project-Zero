# Contribution Guidelines for Project Zero

Welcome to Project Zero! We're excited to have you contribute to our game. Our project is open-source, and we encourage everyone to get involved and contribute in any way they can.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Make your changes and commit them to your forked repository.
3. Create a pull request from your forked repository to the main repository.

## Contribution Rules

We have a few rules for contributors to ensure the codebase remains high quality and easy to maintain:

- Code must be well-documented and follow our coding conventions.
- All pull requests must pass our automated testing and code review process.
- Contributors should not add any malicious code or attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities.

## Future Add-On System

We're working on a system to allow contributors to create and submit add-ons for the game. These add-ons will be reviewed and approved by the project maintainers before being added to the game. We're also planning to support community-hosted servers with custom add-ons.

## Communication

If you have any questions or need help with contributing to our project, please feel free to reach out to us on our Discord server. We also have a dedicated #contributors channel where you can ask for help and get feedback on your contributions.
