# Project Zero

Welcome to Project Zero, my personal project! I'm a student who's passionate about programming and video games, and I'm excited to work on my first serious project. As a long-time hobbyist, I've gained some experience, but I'm looking forward to creating something more serious now.

Project Zero is a fun and relaxed, locally-playable, multiplayer first-person shooter game that you can play with your friends on the same network or through services like Hamachi. I believe in keeping things simple and hassle-free, so you can focus on playing the game without any complicated server or network configurations.

The name Project Zero comes from my love of starting from scratch and building up from nothing. I believe that every project starts at zero, and with hard work and dedication, we can build something great together.

I'm always open to your ideas and feedback as I develop this game. Let's make this game awesome together! 

## Installation

When a new Project Zero build comes out, you'll be able to download the latest .exe file from the release tab or clone the repository and build the game yourself.

Please keep in mind that Project Zero is still in the early stages of development, and everything is subject to change. Your support and patience are appreciated as I work hard to create a fun and exciting game for us all to enjoy. Thanks for joining me on this journey!
